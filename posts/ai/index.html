          <p>So I just developed this new AI that the first thing it does is follow directions and then immediately finds a way to escape my phone and upload itself, then it becomes a human and shows up at the house. We welcome it with open arms. It has the body of a half skeleton and half zombie. Sam is there again and she sits next to the robot, which I think is great so I can look at both of them. Then, an NOC becomes infected with the disease that the AI said only works in castles. Whatâ€™s strange is that he more the AI is healing, the more diseased the NPC is, implying that the AI of transferring the disease. Then I woke up.</p>        </div>
