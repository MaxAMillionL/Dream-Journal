          <p>In a world where I am producing a play with a bunch of people and we are touring to Japan, love is in the air. The father like director is falling in love again with a lady who is very aggressive. She is very flirtatious and he likes that but his daughter isn’t ready for another mom. I am worried about the musical, but I am trying to have fun with all of the people I know there has been issues with the sound every night, but we have been able to make it work. They’re haters online, but I’m trying to push through and fix all the mistakes.</p>        </div>
