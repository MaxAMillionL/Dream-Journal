          <p>I am in this place which I feel as if I’ve been to before. On the map it’s on the outskirts of Elmer. It has a ton of areas like a place with husky’s, a super tall and long bridge, a giant tree, a hidden fort, etc. then today, as I’m exploring one of the husky’s comes and plays with me. I say for it to be me to his home which he does because he wants to play. The other huskies hate me so I don’t. I then look around and find a snake at least 3-5 meters long and has a head bigger than mine. It was similar to a tree trunk in diameter. Then it starts chasing me and the husky across the bridge and I drop my bag. The snake gets the husky and I run to grandparents. Eventually poppop gets home with a friend and I ask for their help. We get the bag and a loot bag without any trouble and this one stranger helps with a ton of gold. He sets off a trap to try to kill us but it’s too old, and he says apollos tricks are old. Then poppops friend is able to stop him and we make it home.</p>        </div>
