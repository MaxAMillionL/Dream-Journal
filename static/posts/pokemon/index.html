          <p>This is the earliest dream I can remember.</p>
<p>When I was around 8, I went to bed surrounded by stuffed animals in a camping tent, by bed setup at the time. When doing so, I dozed into a deep sleep and awoke to the sounds of seagulls cawing. I was in a pair of shorts, a t-shirt, and a baseball cap with sneakers and long socks. I was surrounded by a beach, more of a small peninsula, and ocean. </p>
<p>The island looked to be a combination of all Pok√©mon types (at the time) with each region having a focus on the environment. There was an ice section with arches of ice and people figure skating delicately on the ground. Others were jumping without the effect of gravity on top of the arches. I joined them, beginning to run across the giant horseshoe structures and jumping from one to the next.</p>
<p>Eventually, I fall gracefully back to the ice rink at the bottom surrounded by hot sand. I lookup to the large volcano that is the center of the island, and notice that under it encompassed in a river is a cavern, deep in the heart of this stream. There is a bridge that connects this beachy island to the next, the details of which were foreign and not important, and probably 20 feet beneath was an opening. I dive in without hesitation and swim directly to the cavern, unable to breathe until I reach the opening.</p>
<p>As I surface, I am greeted by three doors, each with the eyes of the Regis. I enter the first to meet Regirock in a long hallway with colorful purple and yellow walls and a rocky floor. I have to do my best to traverse the grounds to reach him, and eventually succeed, throwing a pokeball of some sort (most likely an ultra ball) and successfully catch him.</p>
<p>Next is registeel, who has a metal electrifying floor. It is of no matter, as I skillfully weave around the sparks and reach the hunk of metal to add him to my collection.</p>
<p>Regiice similarly goes down with one ball to the face after a slippery slope of ice shenanigans towards him, approaching not only the legendary but also his demise.</p>
<p>With the three now in my possession, I leave the cave in order to conquer Regigigas, the leader of the Regis. I surface back to the beachy island and am awoken, ending my dream.</p>        </div>
