          <p>There’s a group of people who hunt down souls and stuff for Satan. They are the best devils around and look like people. There’s one in a wheelchair with mind control powers, one who’s big and brawny but a softie, one who’s a Medusa looking girl and a cold killer, one who is tall and skinny and like Robin from Teen Titans, and that all I remember but there was one more. </p>
<p>Robin and the other one go to do something and the other three go through a singing sequence about turning the lava lake into obsidian for fun, then they come back and the whole main area has a ravine. They jump down and fight a bunch of monsters and a god of lava and others for fun. To kill the monsters, the man made them fight each other. To kill the god, the girl took a spear and tridents the snakes over and over to take control. They cut up the gods arm with the fork and used the snakes to choke the god out. Also the wheelchair dude was able to feel in the lava take because the pain goes out throughout the whole body, even if you’re paralyzed. </p>
<p>It had the same vibe as a video game. Also all the characters can never die, and the intro starts with “there is a question in philosophy saying if a man was granted a second life but in exchange he would die earlier in this one, how often will the man kill himself to make his problems go away, and how soon?”</p>        </div>
