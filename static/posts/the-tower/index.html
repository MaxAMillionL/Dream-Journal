          <p>I have to clear a tower made up of 5 major levels and 50 floors total. There are political guild dynamics that make it extremely difficult to actually get ahead, but I manage to find a way. In doing so, I attract the attention of a death knight, a skeleton who fancies the rapier. I use him to clear some stubborn obstacles I otherwise would’ve died from, kiting monsters down the stairs such that they might not each other. I succeed and the death knight seems to like me.</p>
<p>I got into a fight with an elf from the assassins guild earlier, so I try to suck the death knight in her because I’m still afraid of both but they get along and help me out. A lot of people who were tied up in traps and lost in the tower come out, revealing either they’re ghosts like heathers or they’re actually still alive. They tell me to begin on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th doors asap, as the first 2 are now clearer (they weren’t), which is parallel to a key hint I had to do for my ASL project in real life.</p>        </div>
